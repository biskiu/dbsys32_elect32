LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project outlines a Library Management System designed to manage books, borrowers, and rentals. It includes a database schema with defined tables (Books, Borrowers, Rental), and describes the system's main pages: Home, Book Management, Borrower Management, Rental Management, and Rental History. Each page details its purpose, features, and navigation, offering a clear overview of how users can interact with and manage library records.
